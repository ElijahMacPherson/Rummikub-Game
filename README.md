Rummikub-Game


We made a number of smaller test plans to cover the requirements in the context of the game. They are kept in the 'Test Plans' folder, and most are run through the ScenarioTest.java JUnit class. The description of each game is annotated with the specific requirement(s) for each line, and they are also indexed in the correction grid.
