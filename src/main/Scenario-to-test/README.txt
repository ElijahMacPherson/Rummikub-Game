I provided pictures numbered from 1 to 6 showing a simple game between two players that should be good to cover the initial hand of each player, player actions in each turn, tiles players draw, melds on the table and their organization. However, better and more complicated games will be added to cover AI strategies. Moreover the game should cover all the rules and conditions in the picture labelled RulesToImplementandTest.
