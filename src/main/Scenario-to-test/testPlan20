Game starts

Initial Hands:
Human:
G10 G11 G12 
B9 B10 B11 B12
O1

p3:
R6 B6


Human goes first (always).

Human plays initial 30 so..
Human plays {G10, G11, G12} and { B9 B10 B11 B12}

Let's assume P3 can play on melds...

Since human player has 3 fewer tiles, p3 plays everything
P3 can't play anything so instead draws some card // Req 14a
