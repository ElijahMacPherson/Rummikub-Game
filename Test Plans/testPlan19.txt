Initial Hands:
Human:
G10 G11 G12 
B9 B10 B11 B12
O1

p3:
R11 R9 R10 R13
G2 R3 B4 G6 O6 R6 B6


Human goes first (always).

Human plays initial 30 so..
Human plays {G10, G11, G12} { B9 B10 B11 B12}

Let's assume P3 can play on melds...

Since human player has 3 fewer tiles, p3 plays everything
p3 plays {R9 R10 R11} and {B6 G6 O6 R6}
p3 also plays {G13} on {G10, G11, G12} //Req 13b
